; 1. select two distinct big primes p and q
; 2. n = pq
; 3. select a small e for which gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1
;      - phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)
; 4. find e' for which e*e' = 1 (mod (phi n))
;		- is uniquely solvable as a corollary of gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1
;		- can be computed efficiently with extended-euclid 
; 5. publish (e  . n) as the public key
;       keep (e' . n) as the private key
;    private is secret because phi(n) is needed to 
;	  efficiently compute e', and it involves factoring n
;
; messages (being 0 < M < n) can now processed with:
; 	P(M) = expt(M,e) (mod n) = C to encrypt or sign
;  P(C) = expt(C,d) (mod n) = M to decrypt or verify signature
;
; however, you MUST HAVE padding to protect against partial 
; decryption and care in selection of p and q.
; RSASSA-PSS should be a good padding these days
