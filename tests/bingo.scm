; - have threads with ids 0..n
; - each either reads message or sends at random a mail to 0..n with content 0..n
; - when some thread has gotten all numbers 0..n, it sends message to a 'fini thread
; - fini prints the content of the first message and mails 'halt to all 0..n
; - each thread starts dropping messages when 'fini has sent 'halt to them
